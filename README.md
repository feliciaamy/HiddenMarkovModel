To generate the prediction files, go to Main.class to change the algorithm as you like. 
There are 4 prediction algorithms, which are SIMPLE,VITERBI, VITERBIK, and OPTIMIZED.
After selecting the algorithm and run the program, the prediction files will be generated to each language folder in resource.
You can then put the location of the file when running the Evaluation Script
